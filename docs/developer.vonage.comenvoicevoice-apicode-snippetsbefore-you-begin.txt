What are Code Snippets?

Code snippets are short pieces of code you can reuse in your own applications. The code snippets use code from example repositories.

Please read this information carefully, so you can best use the code snippets.

Prerequisites
Create a Vonage account
Rent a Vonage Number
Install the Vonage Command Line tools
Create a Vonage Application using the command line tools or Dashboard
Install the Vonage Library for your programming language
Set up Ngrok

Our blog post on how to use Ngrok.
Replaceable variables
Generic replaceable

The following replaceable information depends on the library and specific call:

Key	Description
VONAGE_API_KEY	

Your Vonage API key (see it on your dashboard).


VONAGE_API_SECRET	

Your Vonage API secret (also available on your dashboard).


VONAGE_APPLICATION_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH	

Private key path.


VONAGE_APPLICATION_PRIVATE_KEY	

Private key.


VONAGE_APPLICATION_ID	

The Vonage Application ID.

Numbers

All phone numbers are in E.164 format.

Key	Description
VONAGE_NUMBER	

Your Vonage Number. E.g. 447700900000


TO_NUMBER	

The number you are calling. E.g. 447700900001


SECOND_NUMBER	

The number you are forwarding to. E.g. 447700900002

UUIDs

UUIDs are typically used in the code snippets to identify a specific call.

Key	Description
UUID	

The UUID of the call leg.

Specific replaceable/variables

Some code snippets have more specialized variables that will need to be replaced by actual values. These may be specified on a per-code snippet basis.

Authentication

Voice API requires authentication using JWTs. You can generate a JWT using the Vonage CLI or the online tool.

Webhooks

The main ones you will meet here are:

/webhooks/answer - Vonage makes a GET request here when you receive an inbound call. You respond with an NCCO.
/webhooks/event - Vonage makes POST requests here when an event occurs. You receive a JSON event.
/webhooks/recordings - Vonage makes a POST request here when the recording is available. You receive a JSON object with recording details.
/webhooks/dtmf - Vonage POSTs user DTMF input here in a JSON object.

If you are using Ngrok you will set your webhook URLs in the Vonage Application object to something like:

https://demo.ngrok.io/webhooks/answer
https://demo.ngrok.io/webhooks/event
https://demo.ngrok.io/webhooks/recordings
https://demo.ngrok.io/webhooks/dtmf

Change demo in the above with whatever applies in your case.
