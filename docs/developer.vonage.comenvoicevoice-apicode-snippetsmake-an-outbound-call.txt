Make an outbound call

This code snippet makes an outbound call and plays a text-to-speech message when the call is answered.

Example

Replace the following variables in the example code:

Key	Description
VONAGE_NUMBER	

Your Vonage Number. E.g. 447700900000


TO_NUMBER	

The number you are calling. E.g. 447700900001


ANSWER_URL	

The answer URL. For example https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nexmo-community/ncco-examples/gh-pages/text-to-speech.json.

Prerequisites
Write the code

Add the following to make-an-outbound-call.sh:

curl -X POST https://api.nexmo.com/v1/calls\
  -H "Authorization: Bearer "$JWT\
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"\
  -d '{"to":[{"type": "phone","number": "'$TO_NUMBER'"}],
      "from": {"type": "phone","number": "'$VONAGE_NUMBER'"},
      "answer_url":["https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nexmo-community/ncco-examples/gh-pages/text-to-speech.json"]}'
