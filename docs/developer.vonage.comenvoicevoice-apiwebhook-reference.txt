Voice API Webhooks Reference

Vonage uses webhooks alongside its Voice API to enable your application to interact with the call. There are two required, and one optional, webhook endpoints:

Answer webhook is sent when a call is answered. This is for both incoming and outgoing calls.
Event webhook is sent for all the events that occur during a call. Your application can log, react to or ignore each event type.
Fallback URL is used when either the Answer or Event webhook fails or returns an HTTP error status.
Errors are also delivered to the event webhook endpoint if they occur.

For more general information, check out our webhooks guide.

Signed Webhooks

Signed webhooks are a way to verify that the request is coming from Vonage and its payload has not been tampered with during transit. Voice API, as well as Messages and Dispatch APIs, support signed callbacks by default. See Decoding signed webhooks to learn how to decode an incoming JWT signature.

Answer Webhook

When an incoming call is answered, an HTTP request is sent to the answer_url you specified when setting up the application. For outgoing calls, specify the answer_url when you make the call.

By default, the answer webhook will be a GET request but this can be overridden to POST by setting the answer_method field. For incoming calls, you configure these values when you create the application. For outgoing calls, you specify these values when making a call.

Answer webhook data fields
Field	Example	Description
to	442079460000	The number that answered the call. (This is the virtual number linked to in your application.)
from	447700900000	The number that called to. (This could be a landline or mobile number, or another virtual number if the call was made programmatically.)
uuid	aaaaaaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd-0123456789ab	A unique identifier for this call
conversation_uuid	CON-aaaaaaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd-0123456789ab	A unique identifier for this conversation
region_url	https://api-ap-3.vonage.com	Regional API endpoint which should be used to control the call with REST API; see the full list of regions here
custom_data	{ "key": "value" }	A custom data object, optionally passed as parameter on the callServer method when a call is initiated from an application using the Client SDK
Transmitting additional data with SIP headers

In addition to the above fields, you can specify any additional headers you need when using SIP Connect. Any headers provided must start with X- and will be sent to your answer_url with a prefix of SipHeader_. For example, if you add a header of X-UserId with a value of 1938ND9, Vonage will add SipHeader_X-UserId=1938ND9 to the request made to your answer_url.

Warning: Headers that start with X-Nexmo will not be sent to your answer_url

Answer webhook data field examples

For a GET request, the variables will be in the URL, like this:

/answer.php?to=442079460000&from=447700900000&conversation_uuid=CON-aaaaaaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd-0123456789ab&uuid=aaaaaaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd-0123456789ab&SipHeader_X-UserId=1938ND9

Copy

If you set the answer_method to POST then you will receive the request with JSON format data in the body:

{
  "from": "442079460000",
  "to": "447700900000",
  "uuid": "aaaaaaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd-0123456789ab",
  "conversation_uuid": "CON-aaaaaaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd-0123456789ab",
  "SipHeader_X-UserId": "1938ND9"
}

Copy
Responding to the answer webhook

Vonage expect you to return an NCCO in JSON format containing the actions to perform.

Event webhook

HTTP requests will arrive at the event webhook endpoint when there is any status change for a call. The URL will be the event_url you specified when creating your application unless you override it by setting a specific event_url when starting a call.

By default the incoming requests are POST requests with a JSON body. You can override the method to GET by configuring the event_method in addition to the event_url.

The format of the data included depends on which event has occurred:

started
ringing
answered
busy
cancelled
unanswered
disconnected
rejected
failed
human/machine
timeout
completed
record
input
transfer
Started

Indicates that the call has been created.

Transfer

This webhook is sent by Vonage when a leg has been transferred from one conversation to another. This can be done using an NCCO or the transfer action

Back to event webhooks list

Fallback URL

The fallback webhook is accessed when either the answer webhook or the event webhook, when the event is expected to respond with an NCCO, returns an HTTP error status or is unreachable. The data that is returned from the fallback URL is the same as would be received in the original answer URL or event URL, with the addition of two new parameters, reason and original_request:

{
  "reason": "Connection closed.",
  "original_request": {
    "url": "https://api.example.com/webhooks/event",
    "type": "event"
  }
}

Copy

If there was a connection closed or reset, timeout or an HTTP status code of 429, 503 or 504 during the initial NCCO the answer_url is attempted twice, then:

Attempt to reach the fallback_answer_url twice
If no success, then the call is terminated

If there was a connection closed or reset, timeout or an HTTP status code of 429, 503 or 504 during a call in progress the event_url for events that are expected to return an NCCO (e.g. return for an input or notify action) is attempted twice, then:

Attempt to reach the fallback_answer_url twice
If no success, continue the call flow
Errors

The event endpoint will also receive webhooks in the event of an error. This can be useful when debugging your application.

Field	Example	Description
reason	Syntax error in NCCO. Invalid value type or action.	Information about the nature of the error
conversation_uuid	CON-aaaaaaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd-0123456789ab	The unique identifier for this conversation
timestamp	2020-01-01T12:00:00.000Z	Timestamp (ISO 8601 format)
