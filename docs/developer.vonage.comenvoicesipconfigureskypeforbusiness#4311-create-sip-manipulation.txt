4.2 Configuring Skype for Business

This section describes the Skype for Business configuration necessary to support connectivity to Oracle E-SBC. A SIP trunk is established between Skype for Business and Oracle E-SBC for use by signaling traffic to and from Nexmo via Oracle E-SBC.

4.2.1 Enable TCP Mode

Skype for Business and Oracle E-SBC will communicate over TCP since UDP is not supported by Skype for Business. To enable TCP mode in Skype for Business follow the steps below.

Navigate to Mediation Pools in the Skype for Business Topology Builder
Here we use the co-located mediation server to communicate with the Oracle E-SBC
Right click and click Edit
Assign Listening ports for TCP on the Skype for Business side
Check Enable TCP Port option
4.2.2 Adding a Trunk

Right click on the PSTN gateways option and select New IP/PSTN Gateway

Enter the IP address of the Oracle E-SBC

Click Next

In Define the root trunk page

Trunk name: 10.64.4.177 (Oracle E-SBC LAN IP)

Listening Port for IP/PSTN Gateway: 5060, Configure the listening port of the SBC

SIP Transport Protocol: Select TCP

Associated Mediation Server: fe01.sfbsp.local, Select the mediation pool to be associated

Associated Mediation Server port: 5060

Click Finish

Publish the topology for the configuration to be reflected

4.2.3 Trunk Configuration
Open the Skype for Business Control Panel
Navigate to Voice Routing
Go to the TRUNK CONFIGURATION page
Click New and select Pool Trunk
In the Select a Service page, select the trunk added in section 4.2.
Assign a name
Set Encryption Support Level: Select Not supported
Set Refer Support: None
Set the remaining options as seen in the figure below
Click OK and Commit the changes.
4.2.4 Voice Routing

The trunk created in the previous step needs to be assigned to a Route. This is done so that when a Skype for Business user dials a call out to the Nexmo, the calls terminate via the configured Oracle E-SBC trunk.

Open the Skype for Business control panel

Navigate to Voice Routing → VOICE POLICY

A Dial Plan can be configured for users if any digit modifications are needed. Here the Global Dial Plan is used.

Configure a Voice Policy for the users to use when dialing a call out to the Oracle E-SBC

Click New under Associated PSTN Usages to create a new PSTN Usage

Assign a name

Click New under Associated Routes to create a new Route

Assign a Name for the new route

Create a match pattern for the calls going out under Build a Pattern to match section. Here "+1214242" is used to match PSTN number.

Select the Trunk under Associated trunks section and click OK

Save the Route

Save the PSTN Usage

Save the Voice Policy

4.2.5 Dial Plan

Dial Plan is used to strip or insert digits.

Navigate to Voice Routing section in the Skype for Business Control Panel

Select Global Dial Plan. Here the Global Dial Plan is used.

Open the Global dial plan

Navigate to Associated Normalization Rules and add normalization rules

Keep All is a default normalization rule which allows all the numbers

Save the changes
