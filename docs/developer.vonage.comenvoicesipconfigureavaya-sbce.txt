4.2 Configuring Avaya Aura Communication Manager

This section describes the Avaya Aura Communication Manager configuration necessary to support connectivity to Avaya SBCe. A SIP trunk is established between Communication Manager and Session Manager for use by signaling traffic to and from Nexmo via Avaya SBCe. It is assumed that the general installation of Communication Manager, the Avaya G430 Media Gateway and Session Manager has been previously completed.

The Avaya Aura Communication Manager configuration was performed using System Access Terminal (SAT) via Putty.

4.2.1 Licenses

In order to connect to Nexmo, Avaya Aura Communication Manager needs to have enough SIP trunk licenses. Use the display system-parameters customer-options command to verify the available SIP Trunk licenses

4.2.2 System Features

Use the change system-parameters features command and ensure Trunk to Trunk Transfer is set to all

4.2.3 IP Node Names

Use the display node-names IP command to verify that node names have been properly defined for Communication Manager (procr) and Session Manager (AASM in this test). These node names will be needed for configuring the Signaling Group later.

4.2.4 IP Codecs

The change ip-codec-set command is used for assigning the proper codecs. For this setup, ip-codec-set 1 is used.

4.2.5 IP Network Region

For this test, IP Network region 3 was created using the change ip-network-region 1 command

4.2.6 Signaling Group

Use the add signaling-group x command to create a signaling group 2 between Communication Manager and Session Manager for SIP trunk calls.

4.2.7 Trunk Group

Use the add trunk-group x command to create trunk groups for the associated signaling group, trunk group 2 is associated with Signaling group 2 for SIP trunk between CM and SM.

The Numbering Format is set to Public. Outbound calls to Nexmo uses this trunk and uses the Public Numbering table to send the calling party number.
Send Diversion Header is enabled to send the diversion information for voice mail.
4.2.8 Route Pattern

Use the change route-pattern 2 command to add routing preference for SIP trunk to Session Manager.

This route is associated with trunk group 2
4.2.9 Dialing Pattern and Feature Code

Use the change dialplan analysis and change feature-access-codes commands

ARS access code is set to 9
4.2.10 Call Routing
 4.2.10.1 Outbound Calls

The change ars analysis command is used for outbound PSTN call routing. 121 is shown as an example setup for this test.

Route pattern 2 is used for PSTN call routing.
4.2.11 Caller ID

The change private-numbering 2 command is used to assign the Caller ID for 4 digit Avaya Aura extensions

Trunk group number 2 is used.
4.2.12 Avaya Aura Extensions

Create a SIP extension as shown below.

Enter station extension.
Application: Type OPS
Trunk Selection: Type aar
4.3 Configuring Avaya Aura Session Manager

The Avaya Aura Session Manager configuration utilizes Avaya Aura System Manager. The Avaya Aura System Manager Web login screen is accessed via https://IP Address/FQDN. Use admin as User ID and input associated password, and then click Log on. It is assumed that the Domain, Location and Endpoint for Session Manager have been previously configured.

Navigate to Home > Elements > Routing

4.3.1 Add Adaptations

Modifications to the SIP messaging within the Session Manager can be made in the Adaptions module. The idea here is to create an adaptation entity, identified by its Name, and then assign it to a SIP Entity.

Navigate to Routing > Adaptations > New

 4.3.1.1 Adaptation for Avaya SBCe

The following adaption rules are provisioned in the "Module parameter" field:

fromto =true: If set to true, then adaptation modifies From and To headers of the message.

An adaptation is created under the Digit Conversion for Outgoing Calls from SM to cause SM to insert the + sign in the From and To headers on SM-originated calls routed to Avaya SBCe.
4.3.2 SIP Entities
 4.3.2.1 SIP Entity for Avaya SBCe
Add the AvayaSBC Adaption created earlier, to the SIP Entity
The link between the SM and the Avaya sBCe was configured as trusted using TCP protocol and port 5060
 4.3.2.2 SIP Entity for Avaya CM
The link between the Avaya SM and the CM was configured as trusted using TCP protocol and port 5060.
 4.3.2.3 SIP Entity for Avaya MM
The link between the Avaya SM and the Avaya MM was configured as trusted using TCP protocol and port 5060
4.3.3 Routing Policies

Navigate to Routing > Routing Policies > New

 4.3.3.1 Routing Policy to Avaya SBCe

Create a routing policy to Avaya SBCe as shown below.

 4.3.3.2 Routing Policy to Avaya CM

4.4.2 Domain Policies
 4.4.2.1 Signaling Rules

Signaling Rules define the actions to be taken (Allow, Block, Block with Response, etc.) for each type of SIP-specific signaling request and response message.

Headers such as P-Location, P-Charging-Vector and others are sent in SIP messages from Session Manager to the Avaya SBCe for egress to the Nexmo.

A Signaling Rule was created, to later be applied in the direction of the enterprise to block unwanted headers coming from Session Manager from being propagated to Nexmo.

 4.4.2.2 End Point Policy Groups

End Point Policy group "Avaya SM" is created as shown below

4.4.3 Device Specific Settings
