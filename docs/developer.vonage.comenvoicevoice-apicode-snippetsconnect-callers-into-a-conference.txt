Connect callers to a conference

This code snippet shows how to join multiple calls into a conversation.

Multiple inbound calls can be joined into a conversation (conference call) by connecting the call into the same named conference.

Conference names are scoped at the Vonage Application level. For example, VonageApp1 and VonageApp2 could both have a conference called vonage-conference and there would be no problem.

Example

Replace the following variables in the example code:

Key	Description
CONF_NAME	

The named identifier for your conference.

Prerequisites
Write the code

Add the following to conference-call.js:

const onInboundCall = (request, response) => {
  const ncco = [
    {
      action: 'talk',
      text: 'Please wait while we connect you to the conference'
    },
    {
      action: 'conversation',
      name: CONF_NAME
    }
  ]

  response.json(ncco)
}

app.get('/webhooks/answer', onInboundCall)

app.listen(3000)
Copy
