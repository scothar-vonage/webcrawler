Run your code

Save this file to your machine and run it:

Copy
bash download-a-recording.sh
Try it out

You will need a Recording URL from which to download the recording file. You typically get this from the JSON response received on the /webhooks/recordings endpoint when the record action is used when recording a call, connecting another call and so on. A typical JSON response will resemble the following:

{'conversation_uuid': 'CON-ddddaaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd-0123456789de',
 'end_time': '2018-08-10T11:19:31Z',
 'recording_url': 'https://api.nexmo.com/v1/files/aaaaaaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd-0123456789ab',
 'recording_uuid': 'ccccaaaa-dddd-cccc-dddd-0123456789ab',
 'size': 162558,
 'start_time': '2018-08-10T11:18:51Z',
 'timestamp': '2018-08-10T11:19:31.744Z'}
1.2.3.4 - - [10/Aug/2018 11:19:31] "POST /webhooks/recordings HTTP/1.1" 200 -

Copy

When you run the script, the recording located at the recording URL will be downloaded. You can then listen to the recording.
