Connect an inbound call

In this code snippet you see how to connect an inbound call to another person by making an outbound call.

Example

Replace the following variables in the example code:

Key	Description
VONAGE_NUMBER	

Your Vonage Number. E.g. 447700900000


YOUR_SECOND_NUMBER	

The number you are connecting to. E.g. 447700900002

Prerequisites
Write the code

Add the following to connect-an-inbound-call.js:

const onInboundCall = (request, response) => {
  const ncco = [{
    action: 'connect',
    from: VONAGE_NUMBER,
    endpoint: [{
      type: 'phone',
      number: YOUR_SECOND_NUMBER
    }]
  }]

  response.json(ncco)
}

app.get('/webhooks/answer', onInboundCall)

app.listen(3000)
Copy

Run your code

Save this file to your machine and run it:

Copy
node connect-an-inbound-call.js
Try it out

You'll need to expose your server to the open internet. During development you can use a tool like Ngrok to do that.

When you call your Vonage Number you will automatically be connected to the number you specified in place of YOUR_SECOND_NUMBER.
