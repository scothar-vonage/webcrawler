Transfer a call

A code snippet that shows how to transfer control of the current call to control by a new NCCO.

Example

Replace the following variables in the example code:

Key	Description
UUID	

The UUID of the call leg.


NCCO_URL	

The URL of the NCCO to execute. URLs must be array type.

Prerequisites
Write the code

Add the following to transfer-a-call.sh:

curl -X PUT https://api.nexmo.com/v1/calls/$UUID \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer "$JWT \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"\
  -d '{"action": "transfer",
      "destination": {"type": "ncco", "url": ["https://developer.nexmo.com/ncco/tts.json"]}}'
Copy

Run your code

Save this file to your machine and run it:

Copy
bash transfer-a-call.sh
Try it out

You will need to:

Set up a call and obtain the call UUID. You could use the 'connect an inbound call' code snippet to do this.
Run the example code to transfer the call.
Control will be transferred to a new NCCO, and you will hear a text-to-speech message to confirm this.
